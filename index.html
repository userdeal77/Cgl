The Benguela (cold) and Agulhas (warm) are key currents around Southern Africa.

                explanation: "Temperature inversion is a reversal of the normal atmospheric condition (where air gets colder with altitude). It happens when a layer of cool air at the surface is overlain by a layer of warmer air. This is common on calm, clear winter nights when the ground radiates heat away quickly, cooling the air directly above it. This phenomenon traps pollutants and can lead to severe smog.",
